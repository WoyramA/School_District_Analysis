# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The School_District_Analysis looks at how original Student data obtained from a District was analyzed with Maria. Data was presented as 4 Deliverables in order to conclusively analyze the budget, as Deliverable 5 to make comparisons and draw final conclusions from the data. A Full_New_Student_Data1,2,3,4 file 
also exists as a combination of all 5 Deliverables in one Jupyter Notebook file in the School_District_Analysis Repository.

## Deliverable 1

https://github.com/WoyramA/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Deliverables/Deliverable%201-Collect%20Data.ipynb

A Jupyter notebooks file where the data is collected, imported as a DataFrame and displayed in a table using the head and tail function.

## Deliverable 2
https://github.com/WoyramA/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Deliverables/Deliverable%202-Prepare%20Data.ipynb

A Jupyter notebooks file of the data preparation where missing and duplicated data is removed and data is displayed. The suffix "th" from the "grade" column is removed and data in converted from a string to an integer.

## Deliverable 3
https://github.com/WoyramA/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Deliverable%203-%20Summarize%20Data.ipynb

A Jupyter notebooks file shows the data summarization where the DataFrame is summarized with the mean math scores and minimum reading scores determined and displayed.

## Deliverable 4
https://github.com/WoyramA/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Deliverable%204-%20Drill%20down%20the%20Data.ipynb

A Jupyter Notebooks file looks into drilling down the data using loc and iloc to narrow down data to specific rows and columns to summarize the 9th grade data, show mean reading scores for 10th grade, and overall reading scores for the 11th and 12th Grades.

## Deliverable 5 
A Jupyter notebooks file analyzes the averafe budget for the District Schools, total numnber of students in descending order and the average math score and school type.
